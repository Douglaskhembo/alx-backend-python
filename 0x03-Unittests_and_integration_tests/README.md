0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Description

This project focuses on implementing unit tests and integration tests for various Python utilities and a GitHub API client class. You will gain hands-on experience in testing isolated functions and full code paths, leveraging Python's built-in testing libraries and best practices.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

 Differentiate between unit and integration tests

 Apply common testing patterns:

Mocking external services (e.g. HTTP requests)

Parametrizing test cases

Using setup/teardown and fixtures

 Use Python testing libraries such as:

unittest

unittest.mock

parameterized

 Test memoized properties and static methods effectively

 Requirements

OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Language: Python 3.7+

Style: pycodestyle (version 2.5)

Each file must:

End with a new line

Be executable (chmod +x filename.py)

Include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions

Use full type annotations
